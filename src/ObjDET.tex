\paragraph{Objectives of the DET subproject:}

The subproject DET is in charge of the construction and commissioning of the P0 and P4 demonstrators, as well as of the development of the {\em SIMulation for the PetaLo Experiment} (SIMPLE) and the {\em Development of the Reconstruction and Analysis environment for Petalo} (RAP). These objectives will be achieved during the first half of the project. During the second half of the project the DET team will contribute to study the performance of PETALO using P4, in particular as a TOF-PET device. 

%Accordingly, the objectives of this subproject are divided in two groups, DET-HARD and DET-SOFT.
