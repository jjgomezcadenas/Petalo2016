\paragraph{Objectives of the IMG subproject:}

The objective of the IMG subproject is the integration of PETALO with a NMR machine and the extraction of biomarkers from the images obtained in the new device. The specific objectives are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Accurate integration of the PET device developed into the Experimental Radiology Unit and NMR room.
\item Acquisition and storage into a clinical PACS of simultaneous images from the PET/MRI device.
\item Software development for attenuation correction.
\item Artefacts correction.
\item Integration of imaging biomarkers in the workflow.
\end{enumerate}
