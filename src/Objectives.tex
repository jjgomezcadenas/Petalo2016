\subsubsection*{Overall objectives:}
The overall objectives of this research proposal are the construction, commissioning and operation of a demonstrator of the LXSC concept (P0) which will be used to show the excellent energy and spatial resolution expected in a LXe-based scintillation detector readout by SiPMs, and the construction, commissioning and operation of a demonstrator of PETALO (P4), which will be used to demonstrate the advantages of the technology for PET (excellent energy and spatial resolution, 3D reconstruction of interaction point minimising parallax errors, separation of photoelectric and Compton events), PET-TOF (based in the excellent time resolution possible thanks to the fast scintillation time of LXe) and PET-NMR combined apparatus. In addition, this project will develop an specialised ASIC (Asic for PETALO, or APE) that will be essential for a large deployment of the technology. 

%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Construction, commissioning and characterisation of the PETALO-2  (P2) prototype. %Demonstration of the energy resolution and spacial resolution of the LXSC. Study of the performance of several configurations (LXSC2, LXSC3, LXSC6). Demonstration of coincidence resolution time (CRT) between the two LXSC of P2. Characterisation of photoelectric and multi-site, fully contained Compton events. 
%\item Development of front end electronics (FEE) and data acquisition (DAQ) for P2. 
%\item Construction, commissioning and characterisation of the PETALO-10 (P10) small animal PET in a non-clinical environment.
%\item Development of FEF and DAQ optimised for P10.
%\item Characterisation and study of performance of P10  in a clinical environment.  
%\item Operation and optimisation of  P10 in a NMR environment.
%\item Image processing and reconstruction combining PET and NMR data. 
%\item Optimisation of  P10 as TOF-PET apparatus.
%\item Development of an ASIC optimised for energy resolution, fast time response, and operation at cryogenic (LXe) temperatures and high magnetic field environment. 
%\end{enumerate}

The objectives presented in this project are very well aligned to the Spanish program for science. They involve a direct technology transfer from a basic science experiment in particle physics to a medical imaging application of high social impact (Reto 1: Salud). It involves a multidisciplinary collaboration between physicist, engineers and medical doctors. And it has a large potential for generating commercial spinoffs, including the possibility of a break through in  PET-TOF, PET-NMR technology.
