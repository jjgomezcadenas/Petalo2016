\paragraph{Objectives of the ASIC subproject:}
The ASIC subproject is in charge of providing the front end electronics (FEE), data acquisition (DAQ) and slow controls (SC) for the P0 and P4 apparatus.  In addition the subproject will develop an ASIC for PETALO (APE), optimised for energy resolution, fast time response, and operation at cryogenic (LXe) temperatures and high magnetic field environment.
